I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments.
They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere.
This course is the most straight-forward technical deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure.
It's a treasure by the group of Kevin Webster at Imperial College London.
Also, this project is strongly influenced from the work of [Aman Chadha](https://aman.ai/).
